# Phase 1

For our first pilot, this would run weekly for three (3) months, with each session lasting for approximately two (2) hours with breaks.
The **technical material** to be covered during this phase would involve:

+ Introduction to Programming
+ Introduction to Python

This is our core program, introducing the idea of a programming language and what it means to tell a computer what to do. We'll cover basic interaction with the Python console using statements to manipulate numbers and text. Next, we'll move on to  introducing loops and functions. 

Finally, all the students would collectively build a biography app that collects basic information about you and gives you back a summarized story of yourself. Throughout the class, students will learn not just the code, but the **why** behind the code, setting a strong foundation for future growth.
