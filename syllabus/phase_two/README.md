# Phase 2

This would also run weekly for three (3) months. Here, we would delve in a little deeper. We will build on what kids learned in "Intro to Programming" and build on it to strengthen skills. Through practical examples, students will gain a deeper understanding of programming and how it is applied in the real world. Example projects will reinforce understanding of fundamentals while encouraging experimentation and exploration.

Programming is a lot like speaking a foreign language or playing a musical instrument. In order to become proficient, the student needs to practice - and the more practice the better, so our goal is to keep them coding.
We would start off by building various applications such as games, calculators etc. Next, for those interested, we would have an introduction to basic hardware components.
